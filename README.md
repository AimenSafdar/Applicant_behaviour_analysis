# Applicant Behavior Analysis – Internee.pk

## Project Overview
This project analyzes user behavior on Internee.pk to understand the applicant journey, identify drop-off points, and improve application completion rates. Using Python and data analytics, key insights were extracted from a realistic dataset simulating user interactions on the platform.

## Objective
- Analyze the applicant funnel from website visit to application submission.
- Identify stages where users drop off.
- Understand device and traffic source performance.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve user experience and conversion rates.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas (Data manipulation & analysis)
- VS Code  (Development environment)
- CSV (Data storage)

## Project Workflow
1. Data Collection: Generated a realistic dataset of user interactions (30–50 rows) including page visits, device type, traffic source, and application stage.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Checked for missing values and ensured consistent formatting.
3. Funnel Analysis: Tracked user journey from Home → Internship Listing → Internship Detail → Application Form → Confirmation Page.
4. Drop-Off Analysis: Identified stages where users exited before completing applications.
5. Device Conversion Analysis: Compared completion rates across devices (desktop vs mobile).
6. Traffic Performance Analysis: Evaluated which traffic sources brought high-quality users.
7. Conversion Rate Calculation: Measured overall application completion rate.
8. Insights & Recommendations: Derived actionable suggestions to improve user journey and conversion.

## Key Insights
1. High initial engagement on Home → Internship Listing → Internship Detail.
2. Significant drop-off occurs at the Application Form stage (~33% exit).
3. Desktop users have higher conversion rates than mobile users.
4. LinkedIn traffic produces the highest quality applicants.
5. Overall conversion rate is ~44%.

## Recommendations
1. Simplify the application form and reduce mandatory fields.
2. Optimize mobile experience for better form completion.
3. Focus marketing efforts on LinkedIn due to higher conversion.
4. Allow users to save progress to reduce drop-offs.
5. Monitor funnel metrics regularly to measure improvements.
